# How to Add iPhone Screenshots

To replace the placeholder screenshots with the actual iPhone screenshots, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Save the iPhone Screenshots

From your attachment images, save them as:

1. **First screenshot** (Budgeting Made Easy - blue background with phone showing overview) 
   → Save as: `public/images/screenshots/budgeting-made-easy.png`

2. **Second screenshot** (Trends Over Time - blue background with phone showing trends chart)
   → Save as: `public/images/screenshots/trends-over-time.png`

3. **Third screenshot** (Understand Your Spending - blue background with phone showing pie chart)
   → Save as: `public/images/screenshots/understand-spending.png`

4. **Fourth screenshot** (Track Your Spending - blue background with phone showing transactions)
   → Save as: `public/images/screenshots/track-spending.png`

## Step 2: Optimal Image Settings

For best results, crop/resize the images to:
- **Format**: PNG (for transparency support)
- **Width**: 400-600px (the component will auto-resize)
- **Height**: 800-1200px (maintaining iPhone aspect ratio)
- **Background**: Keep the blue gradient background from the original

## Step 3: After Adding Images

Once you've saved the images, the website will automatically display them in place of the placeholders. The iPhone mockup frames will perfectly showcase your actual app screenshots.

## File Structure

```

    │   ├── budgeting-made-easy.png     ← Replace this
    │   ├── trends-over-time.png        ← Replace this

    ├── logo.png

The website is already set up to display these images beautifully in iPhone mockups with descriptions and feature lists!
